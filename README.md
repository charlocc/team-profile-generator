# Team Profile Generator

# by Charlotte Clark

## Technologies Used:

* Javascript / Node.js

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
To run this program, open the program in your terminal, and type "node index". You will be given the choice to add Managers, Engineers, and Interns to build your team. You can add as many as you want, just enter the "Done" selection when you have finished adding team members. This will create an HTML file with team member cards for each added team member.
If you add a manager, you will enter their name, employee ID, email address, and office number. If you add an engineer, you will enter their name, employee ID, email address, and github username.
If you add an intern, you will enter their name, employee ID, email address, and the school they attend.
If you click on an email address in the HTML, then your default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address, and if you click on the GitHub username then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
